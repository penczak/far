find and replace

fnr or far

(a set of?)
pattern(s) to search for
text to replace matches with 

to start a session:
-search space directory
-patterns (above) 
-optionally a pattern to filter files 

display list of hits 
-shows whole line with match highlighted 
    -(how to deal with multiple matches in one line? they will become multiple hits)
-[t]ake or [s]kip the hit (and move cursor forward)
    -replace match in display with value to be replaced when taken (and in green)
-show current line at center with previous decisions above and upcoming below
-button to [e]xpand the context 
    -show 5 lines above and below the current line in its file 
    -e to collapse the expansion and go back to normal mode
    -up and down will scroll in file while in expanded mode 
-up and down (u and d or arrow keys) will scroll and move the cursor up and down the list of hits 
    -or j and k with u and d for half screen scroll
    -if going with vim bindings... h for take and l for skip? eh, i think t and s is better
-status bar always at bottom with cursor pos & total number of hits (13 of 254), # taken, # skipped, # undecided

-vim style number+command combos 
    -15t - take the next 15 hits
    -10s - skip the next 10 hits
    -support for movement commands too, j,k,u,d,⬆️,⬇️

-if you scroll past some hits and leave then undecided, have a command to toggle to sort display hits with all undecided at the bottom (and toggle back to original order) 

-beforing applying any changes, make sure files havent been written to since starting session
